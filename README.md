# Sizemore_PHYS5070_Final
Final project repo for Physics 5070 

This repository contains the code necessary to run a double pendulum model using Python. 
User will find the necessary Conda environment along with double pendulum function and
testing suite for the function. In the Jupyter Notebook, user can explore how the path 
of a double pendulum is impacted by changes in the initial conditions of the simulation.
Further, there is content to show how to animate the simulation and discussion on the 
double pendulum and it's applications to weather forecasting.
