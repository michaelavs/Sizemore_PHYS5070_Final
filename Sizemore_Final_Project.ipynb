    "# Creating Chaos: The Double Pendulum and The Weather #\n",
    "\n",
    "The double pendulum is a simple system that shows rich dynamic motion along with sensitivity to changes in initial conditions. The double pendulum is not only a great analytical math and physics problem, but also shows why weather forecasts cannot be considered accurate past a certain timeframe (usually around 7 days). To better understand the overlap in the double pendulum and weather forecasts, one should first understand Chaos theory. Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can, in principle, be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#Introduction). With this in mind, we can now apply the principals of weather forecasting to the double pendulum. \n",
    "\n",
    "In forecasting the weather, a meteorologist will take multiple runs of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, and then use the outcomes from each run to then determine the most likely outcome for the weather within the forecast period. In each run of the NWP, the forecaster will define a specific set of intial conditions based off of in-situ and remote sensing data collection methods, and then run the models based on each of these possible sets of conditions. These conditions can range from upper level atmospheric pressure and cloud cover, to surface wind speed and topological features. As a front moves from one place to another, it can encounter a range of conditions that can all create vastly different outcomes for the system in the matter of minutes to days. Both minor and major changes to the initial conditions defined in the NWP model result in vastly different weather forecasts, similar to the impacts of changing the initial conditions of the double pendulum. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore three changes to intial conditions of the double pendulum system:\n",
    "- Changing mass of lower arm of the pendulum\n",
    "- Changing length of lower arm if the pendulum\n",
    "- Changing initial theta value of lower arm of the pendulum\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these changes can be viewed as a different intial conditon used in weather forecasting, however, there are far too many conditions that impact a weather forecast so I do not want to assert any direct cross comparisons. For the sake of general knowledge, some of the specific conditons that impact weather forecasts are:\n",
    "- Temperature \n",
    "- Humidity \n",
    "- Precipitation \n",
    "- Air pressure \n",
    "- Wind speed \n",
    "- Wind direction\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can't do a direct one-to-one thought experiment of initial conditions, we can think about the two pendulum arms as \"short term\" (weather within 1-3 days) weather and \"long term\" (weather past 5 days) weather. The short term weather will most likely not experience a sudden and/or drastic change unless acted upon by a strong outside force. In comparison, we wouldn't expect the upper arm path to stray too far from a back and forth motion that is no higher that it's initial release point, except when being heavily influenced by the lower arm path motions. Likewise, we would expect the long term forecast to have many different possible paths depending on what conditions it experiences, just as we expect the same for the lower arm path depending on its initial conditions. Therefore, the upper arm will represent the short-term weather forecast and the the lower arm will represent the long term forecast in these double pendulum simulations."

    "The double pendulum simulation is used in Atmospheric Sciences to as an example of how the weather is considered a chaotic system. The application that is usually used is that if the lower arm flips, the weather will be sunny, if it doesnt, the weather will be cloudy. Then you run the similation for a specific time period and count how many flips occur. What the audience should notice is that as time moves on, it becomes more and more difficult to predict if the lower arm will spin or not. Then, to add another level to the demonstration, the instructor can change the initial conditions and run the simulation again, once again counting how many times the lower arm spins in the time period. \n",

    "To bring more life to this project, let's animate a singular double pendulum plot using matplotlib. Try to vary different parameters below and see how the resulting animation changes! To start the animation after making any desired changes to L, m, or y0, simply run this cell as you would a normal cell. To stop the animation, click the 'power' symbol in the top right corner of the displayed plot/animation below.\n",
